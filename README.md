# OHDSI Health Equity Workgroup

*We aim to engage critically and intentionally in all of our work, considering not only the results but the potential interpretation and impact of results, steering clear of work that reinforces health disparities and misinterpretations that generate stigma, and lifting up work which is likely to contribute to health equity.*

## Objectives and Key Results
2021-07 - 2022-07

### Generate and disseminate real-world evidence about the substantial public health issue of health inequities 
 - 3 fully-reproducible study packages executed across at least 20 OHDSI data partners 
 - 10 publications accepted in peer-reviewed journals 
 - 10 instances of presentations of our work 
 - 10 uses of OHDSI results by internal or external stakeholders that demonstrate influence in policy or clinical decision-making 

### Operationalize patient-level Social Determinants of health, Risk factors, and Needs (SDRN) data in OHDSI network studies [[1]](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20191025.776011/full/)
 - Identify OHDSI sites that are collecting SDRN and gather a report of what exists in those source systems. Publish a catalog.
 - Identify 5 priority use cases for patient-level SDRN
 - Ensure OMOP vocabulary and CDM supports storing, collecting, and mapping the relevant common data elements. 
 - Provide a recommendation (to data collectors like health systems) for screening tools useful for Health Equity research
 - Identify standard concepts for the data collected in recommended and commonly used screening tools
 - Engage with NLP team to release tools/methods for extracting SDRN from notes
 - Validate NLP tool for extracting SDoH in the context of a study

### Standards for studying community-level SDRN
 - Identify 3 external datasets useful for incorporation in health equity studies 
 - Identify a priority use case for linking place-based SDoH datasets to OMOP data 
 - Identify a priority use case for rolling up patient-level OMOP data to describe spatial-population-level properties 
 - Release a study package using GIS tools to gain a better understanding of health inequities 

### Extend OHDSI tools to make a health equity perspective the default and/or an option 
 - Augment Patient Level Prediction (PLP) to expose the differences of predictions, predictive power, and other fairness metrics of the predictive models it creates. 
 - Release tools to assess data quality / gaps for SDoH 
 - Develop a framework for best practices in health equity across study design  

### Engage the broader community on issues related to health equity 
 - Release directories of accessible educational resources and research relevant to health equity 
 - Engage early-stage researchers group for researcher diversity and inclusion in our work 
 - Engage education workgroup for health equity educational content 
 - Organize health equity reading group / journal club 

### Support the work of the group 
 - Apply, as a group, for a grant

# Accessible educational resources on health equity
This document contains a few readings, lectures, papers, and content that might otherwise be helpful for people to understand more about health equity research. This list will grow and change - feel free to suggest edits!

## Good introductions to health equity and fairness research:
A lecture by Pilar Ossorio at MLHC [Professor of Law and Bioethics at the University of Wisconsin Law School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzGSlWu4Lj0&list=PLRqwW7v078fYdZFpf43d0NBh4hiGCRtfV&index=6) that summarizes an overview of what is equity, fairness, and how these concepts apply to healthcare
For those that are text-based learners, this paper by Dunkelau and Leuschel in 2019 summarizes Fairness-aware Machine Learning, available [online](https://www.phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de/fileadmin/Redaktion/Institute/Sozialwissenschaften/Kommunikations-_und_Medienwissenschaft/KMW_I/Working_Paper/Dunkelau___Leuschel__2019__Fairness-Aware_Machine_Learning.pdf). 

## A smattering of research papers, recent news, and readings:
 - Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations - Science, 2019. Available [here](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6464/447). Fair ML Keynote [talk](https://slideslive.com/38923132/bad-proxies) + [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mHkgTYuLMSPnM58h5n0FGwSf2tPPxmL5/view) available here. This is Obermeyer’s paper that was much talked-about in the press about how there were differences in outcomes across Black/white patients from the Optum health-risk algorithm that could potentially lead to differences in healthcare treatment. The major takeaway was to adjust outcome variables away from using cost as a metric.
 - How scientists are subtracting race from medical risk calculators - Science, 2021. Available [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/07/how-scientists-are-subtracting-race-medical-risk-calculators). As the title suggests, the article summarizes the effort to now remove race from medical risk calculations. The authors provide a good summary of how race has previously been used in medicine [for good, or for scientifically-inappropriate measurements like the eGFR calculation].
 - Fairness through awareness - 2011. Available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3913). This is an old-ish paper in computer science that summarizes how being aware of a protected class can lead to differences in fairness outcomes; the seminal paper that summarizes

## Various books that discuss the implications of algorithms trained on big data:
 - [Race After Technology](https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/race-after-technology), by Ruha Benjamin [Professor of African American studies at Princeton University], summarizes how technology [from data collection, data imputation, government policy, etc] can play a role in different outcomes in society. 
 - Weapons of Math Destruction, by Cathy O’Neil [mathematician, data scientist, author] discusses the implications of algorithms and how big data can reinforce pre-existing inequities.
