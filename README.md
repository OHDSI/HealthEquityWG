# OHDSI Health Equity Workgroup

*We aim to engage critically and intentionally in all of our work, considering not only the results but the potential interpretation and impact of results, steering clear of work that reinforces health disparities and misinterpretations that generate stigma, and lifting up work which is likely to contribute to health equity.*

## Objectives and Key Results
2021-07 - 2022-07

### Generate and disseminate real-world evidence about the substantial public health issue of health inequities 
 - 3 fully-reproducible study packages executed across at least 20 OHDSI data partners 
 - 10 publications accepted in peer-reviewed journals 
 - 10 instances of presentations of our work 
 - 10 uses of OHDSI results by internal or external stakeholders that demonstrate influence in policy or clinical decision-making 

### Patient-Level SDoH 
 - Identify 5 priority use cases for patient-level SDoH, providing recommendations for storing, collecting, and mapping the relevant common data elements 
 - Provide a recommendation (to data collectors like health systems) for screening tools useful for HE research 
 - Identify standard concepts for the data collected in recommended and commonly used screening tools 
 - Engage with NLP team to release tools/methods for extracting SDoH from notes
 - Validate NLP tool for extracting SDoH in the context of a study 

### Community-Level SDoH 
 - Identify 3 external datasets useful for incorporation in health equity studies 
 - Identify a priority use case for linking place-based SDoH datasets to OMOP data 
 - Identify a priority use case for rolling up patient-level OMOP data to describe spatial-population-level properties 
 - Release a study package using GIS tools to gain a better understanding of health inequities 

### Extend OHDSI tools to make a health equity perspective the default and/or an option 
 - Augment Patient Level Prediction (PLP) to expose the differences of predictions, predictive power, and other fairness metrics of the predictive models it creates. 
 - Release tools to assess data quality / gaps for SDoH 
 - Framework for best practices in health equity across study design  

### Engage the broader community on issues related to health equity 
 - Release directories of accessible educational resources and research relevant to health equity 
 - Engage early-stage researchers group for researcher diversity and inclusion in our work 
 - Engage education workgroup for health equity educational content 
 - Organize health equity reading group / journal club 

### Support the work of the group 
 - Apply, as a group, for a grant
